# OpenTelemetry Chaos Simulator Sample

Interactive chaos engineering sandbox for exploring OpenTelemetry with failure injection.

![](.img/screenshot.png)

## What is this?

A hands-on Angular/ASP.NET Core application designed for experimenting with chaos engineering and observability. Features an interactive network diagram where you can:

- **Inject failures** - Click connections to break/restore them and observe how failures propagate
- **Send requests** - Trigger SQL or Redis requests and watch animated request flows
- **Observe telemetry** - See how failures affect the telemetry generated by OpenTelemetry
- **Visualize in APM** - View traces, metrics, and logs in Immersive APM

The application is preconfigured with an OpenTelemetry exporter - no code changes or API keys needed.

## Features

- **Interactive Network Diagram** - SVG-based visualization of system components with animated request flows
- **Chaos Injection** - Click connections to break/restore them and observe failure propagation
- **Animated Request Flows** - Watch cyan photon-style dots travel through the request lifecycle (Client → API → Resource → Client)
- **Telemetry Visualization** - Orange animated flows show how telemetry propagates to OpenTelemetry and APM destinations
- **Visual Health Indicators** - Green/red pulsing status indicators show connection health in real-time
- **Futuristic Dark Theme** - Cyberpunk-inspired UI with neon glow effects, glassmorphism, and animated backgrounds
- **CSS-Based Animations** - High-performance pure CSS animations for smooth 60fps visuals
- **Coming Soon** - Message Broker and Worker components for async messaging scenarios

## What this is not

This is not a comprehensive OpenTelemetry demo. For exhaustive OpenTelemetry capabilities, check out the [OpenTelemetry demo](https://github.com/open-telemetry/opentelemetry-demo).

## Recommended Audience

- Developers exploring OpenTelemetry concepts
- Those wanting quick experimentation without local setup
- Anyone curious about observability in distributed systems
- Teams learning how failures appear in APM tools

## What is a sandbox?

When deployed, each user gets an isolated environment to conduct experiments independently. Each sandbox has its own telemetry stream, so your chaos experiments won't affect other users.

## Getting Started

### Live Demo

A demo is deployed at [demo.iapm.app](https://demo.iapm.app/)

**Try it out:**

1. Click connections to break/restore them
2. Click SQL or Redis buttons to send requests
3. Watch the animated request flows
4. Wait 30 seconds for telemetry to appear in APM
